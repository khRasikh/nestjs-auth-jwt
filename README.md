# Authentication & Authorization in Nestjs
## Description 

I have found Nestjs framework useful for building efficient, scalable, and reliable server-side applications. In this basic app, I have used some modern JavaScript and TypeScript features such as JWT Authentication, Authorization, CRUD operations to Relational Database, and many more for practice purposes only :)

Here's the technology used: 
- [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/): For Back-End
- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/): for Front-End
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/table-layout)
- [PSQL](https://www.postgresguide.com/utilities/psql/): for storing Data
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): for storing Data
